   * When writing tests, one would often like to re-use certain values for multiple
   * tests. For instance, we would like to create an Int-set and have multiple test
   * about it.
   *
   * Instead of copy-pasting the code for creating the set into every test, we can
   * store it in the test class using a val:
   *
   *   val s1 = singletonSet(1)
   *
   * However, what happens if the method "singletonSet" has a bug and crashes? Then
   * the test methods are not even executed, because creating an instance of the
   * test class fails!
   *
   * Therefore, we put the shared values into a separate trait (traits are like
   * abstract classes), and create an instance inside each test method.
